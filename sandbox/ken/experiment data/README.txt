Experiment 01-04 represent positional data collection while experiments 05-08 represent palm normal
data collection.
When conducting experiments 01-04, the hand begins at a center position, then moves up, down, back
to center, left, right, back to center, and then is pulled toward the user to be removed from frame.
When conducting experiments 05-08, the hand begins at a central position with neutral orientation,
then is rotated counter-clockwise three times before being removed from the frame.

In experiments 01 and 05, all filters are enabled.
In experiments 02 and 06, the pointer and normalize filters are disabled.
In experiments 03 and 07, the normalization filter is disabled.
In experiments 04 and 08, the pointer filter is disabled.
As the hand filter drives the data collection, experiments required it being enabled at all times.

The data sets 'experiment_x' refer to data collected with relatively quick user input. The data sets
'slow_ex_x' refer to data collected with deliberately slow user input. The latter data sets
have more points of data than the former data sets because of this difference.
